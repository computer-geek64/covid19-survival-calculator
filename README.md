# Coronavirus Recovery Probability Calculator

*[COVID-19 Global Hackathon](https://covid-global-hackathon.devpost.com/)*

### This calculator is a web application that allows users who have coronavirus (COVID-19) to calculate the probability of their recovery. We devised a machine learning algorithm that can accurately predict this value, taking into account a wide variety of factors, including information such as pre-existing medical conditions and local population statistics.
